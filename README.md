Both of the time frames had consisently nice temperatures. There are a few differences between the two.
* June temperatures had more data to go off of with almost 200 more data points.
* As expected, June had higher temperatures across the board.
* December had a higher deviation between temperatures.

## Summary
After analysing both months, June was the better surf month based on temperature alone. That being said there are other factors that should be taken into account. First I would take time to check rain fall during both months as storms could severely impact surfing. Likewise a query that analyses wind speed and frequency should be taken into account for the same reason.
